# Sloving problem by creating objects is one of  the most popular approches programming
# This called objects orinted programming  


''' The term object stems from the fact that 
the model resembles objects in the real word in that each object is a thing that has 
certain attributes and characteristics that make it unique '''


# Example: 1

''' We all know cars right diffrent model , year, etc When we  see as one . 
But its not it as diffrent attributes that make unique , They have certain methods in common, where a method is an action or a thing the car can do. For example, cars all 
have go, stop, and turn actions you can control pretty much the same in each one of cars'''


# Cars class 

# Attributes  : methods
#   .year        .go()
#   .make        .stop()
#   .model       .turn()
#   .colors      .heat()
#   .doors       .park()



# Even people can easily be viewed as objects in this manner. In your code, you 
# could create a Member class with which you manage your site members. Each 
# member would have certain attributes, such as a username, full name, and so 
# forth. You could also have methods such as .archive() to deactivate an account 
# and .restore() to reactivate an account. The .archive() and .restore()


# methods are behaviors that let you control membership, in much the same way the 
# accelerator, brake, and steering wheel allow you to control a car. 



# This business of classes and instances stems from a type of programming 
# called object-oriented programming (OOP for short). Itâ€™s been a major concept 
# in programming the biz for a few decades now. Python, like any significant, serious, modern 
#  language is object-oriented.
